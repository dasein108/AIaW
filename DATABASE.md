## Permission Model

### Workspace Roles

### Public vs Private Workspaces
- **Public workspaces**:
  - Visible to anyone
  - Anyone can join as a member
  - Content readable by anyone
- **Private workspaces**:
  - Only visible to members
  - Must be invited by admin or owner
  - Content only accessible to members

- `Owner can delete workspace`: Only owner can delete workspace

### workspace_members
- **SELECT policy**: Can read member lists if admin/member OR workspace is public
  - Admins and owners can always view workspace members
  - Current workspace members can view other members
  - Anyone can view members of public workspaces
- **INSERT policy**: Can join if admin OR self-joining public workspace
  - Admins and owners can add anyone to the workspace
  - Users can add themselves to public workspaces as members
- **UPDATE policy**: Only admin/owner can change roles
  - Only workspace admins and owners can modify member roles
- **DELETE policy**: Admin/owner can remove anyone, users can leave
  - Admins and owners can remove any member
  - Users can remove themselves (leave the workspace)

### chats
- `Workspace members can create workspace chats`: Only workspace members (admin/member) can create workspace chats
- `Admin can CRUD any workspace chat`: Workspace admins have full control of workspace chats
- `Chat owner or workspace admin can delete chat`: Owner or admin can delete chats
- `Anyone can read public workspace chats`: Public workspace chats are readable by anyone
- `Members can read private workspace chats`: Private workspace chats only visible to workspace members
- `Anyone can create private chats`: Any user can create private chats
- `Chat members can update private chats`: Only members can update private chats
- `Chat members can read private chats`: Only members can read private chats
- `Chat owner can delete private chats`: Only owner can delete private chats

### chat_members
- `Anyone can join public chats`: Users can join public chats without invitation
- `Chat owner can manage members`: Chat owner or workspace admin can manage chat members

### messages
- `Messages inherit chat permissions`: Message access follows parent chat permissions
- `Admin can CRUD any workspace message`: Admins have full control of messages in workspace chats
- `Chat members can create messages`: Only chat members can create messages
- `Message sender can update own messages`: Users can edit their own messages

## Data Relationships

### Key Relationships
- Workspaces can have parent-child relationships
- Assistants can have parent-child relationships through parent_id
- Chats can belong to workspaces
- Dialog messages belong to dialogs
- Message contents belong to dialog messages
- Chat members link users to chats
- Workspace members link users to workspaces
- User workspaces provide a denormalized view of user-to-workspace relationships

### Cascade Deletes
The database uses ON DELETE CASCADE extensively to maintain referential integrity:
- When a workspace is deleted, all its chats, members, dialogs, etc. are deleted
- When a chat is deleted, all its messages and members are deleted
- When a dialog is deleted, all its messages and message contents are deleted

## Triggers and Automation

- `add_workspace_owner_as_member_trigger`: Automatically adds workspace owner as admin member
- `sync_user_workspaces_insert_trigger` and `sync_user_workspaces_delete_trigger`: Maintain user_workspaces table
- When a workspace is created, the owner is automatically added as an admin member
- When users are added to workspace_members, a record is automatically added to user_workspaces
- When users are removed from workspace_members, the corresponding record is removed from user_workspaces
- User profiles are automatically created when users sign up

## Security Considerations

### Security Definer Functions
All permission-checking functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` and execute with row security disabled to prevent RLS from interfering with permission checks.

### Parameter Naming
Functions use clear parameter naming (`workspace_id_param`, `chat_id_param`) to avoid column ambiguity in function bodies.

### Ownership Validation
All content access is validated through chains of ownership:
- User owns dialog → Dialog contains messages → Messages contain content
- User is member of chat → Chat contains messages → User can access messages

## Recent Schema Changes

### Assistant Sharing and User Workspaces (August 2025)
- Added `parent_id` and `is_shared` to user_assistants table for inheritance and sharing
- Created `assistant_sharing_type` ENUM with 'global' and 'workspace' values
- Added `can_manage_assistant` function to handle complex assistant permissions
- Created `user_workspaces` table for fast user-workspace relationship lookups
- Added triggers to maintain user_workspaces data automatically
- Enhanced RLS policies for shared assistants (global and workspace-level)

### Enhanced Access Control (July 2025)
- Added `is_workspace_admin_or_owner` function to centralize permission checks
- Added `is_workspace_member` function for membership verification
- Enhanced chat access control with `can_manage_chat` function
- Implemented clear distinction between workspace and private chats
- Improved parameter naming in functions to avoid ambiguity

### Chat Type Simplification (June 2025)
- Simplified chat types from three values (workspace, group, private) to two (workspace, private)
- Updated chat-related RLS policies to use workspace membership for access control
- Enhanced workspace public/private access model with is_public flag
